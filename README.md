# e-plantShopping
Created the front end of a "Paradise Nursery" shopping application using JavaScript React.

The application have three pages: a **landing page**, a **product listing page**, and a **shopping cart page**.

The application interface will allow users to browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shoppng cart. The shopping cart feature lets users view all selected items and their total cost. 
The shopping cart should also provide the option to adjust the number of items before checkout.
